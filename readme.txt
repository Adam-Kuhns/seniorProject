Our project is a 2D platform fighting game called MadBlade. Players fight enemies, jump between platforms, and collect power-ups as they progress through each level. MadBlade uses the Unity game engine and is written in C#.


This is the source code for the Unity project in its entirety and can be loaded into the unity editor to be modified or built.
